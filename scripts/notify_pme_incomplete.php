<?php
// Daily reminder: emails every boss (pme.hodid) a digest of their PME
// evaluations whose evaluation period has ENDED (to_date < today) but that are
// still not completed.
//
// The to_date cutoff deliberately matches the Evaluate button's unlock rule in
// staff/hod/pme/pme.php - that button stays locked ("Evaluation period not
// ended yet") until today is past to_date, so reminding a boss any earlier
// would nag them daily about a row they physically cannot open. Same reasoning
// as scripts/notify_attendance_incomplete.php, which waits for the training to
// end before chasing anyone.
// A boss stops appearing - and stops being emailed - the moment all their
// pending rows move to 'approved'/'completed'/'verified', since the query
// below simply won't return them anymore.
//
// Runnable two ways:
//  - CLI (php scripts/notify_pme_incomplete.php) - no token needed, CLI access
//    already implies server access. This is how cron runs it on the VPS, via
//    scripts/run_reminders.sh. See that file for the crontab line.
//  - HTTP GET with a matching ?key= token, for hosts with no cron feature -
//    point an external scheduler at this URL once a day:
//      https://<your-domain>/ldms/scripts/notify_pme_incomplete.php?key=c23c26f50df52e734e73c1e4e43c598b476594355ff6e8bc
//    portal2.phn.com.my sits behind Cloudflare with Bot Fight Mode on, which
//    challenges/blocks non-browser HTTP clients (confirmed: GitHub Actions'
//    and likely cron-job.org's datacenter IPs get a "Just a moment" 403,
//    while a normal office/ISP-IP client passes straight through) - so the
//    scheduler needs to run somewhere with an IP Cloudflare doesn't flag,
//    e.g. Windows Task Scheduler on an ordinary server, not a cloud CI runner.
//    Change PME_REMINDER_TOKEN below before relying on this in production -
//    the value here is a placeholder generated for setup, not a secret kept
//    out of source control.
define('PME_REMINDER_TOKEN', 'c23c26f50df52e734e73c1e4e43c598b476594355ff6e8bc');

// real boss, with the subject tagged with who it was actually meant for.
// Empty string = live - sends to the real boss addresses.

    // where the CLI has no limit. Each Office365 SMTP send takes a second or two,
    // so once enough bosses are due the run can exceed it and be killed partway.
    // Because the dedup row is written up front, a kill skips the remaining bosses

    // repeat daily - the bosses early in the sort order would be the only ones
    // ever reminded.
